##The project analyze the Carlifornia real estate market in 1990. The project includes 2 parts:
===

### 1. Exploratory data analysis
In this part I explore the specialties of each feature and relationship between features and values. Try to find the pattern between house price and other features. 
###2. Build prediction model
 Based on the previous exploration, I build pipeline that handle data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and model tuning.
